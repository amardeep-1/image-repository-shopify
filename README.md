# Image Repository Shopify
This is what I made for the Summer 2021 - Shopify Developer Intern Challenge Question. The task was to build an image repository using any technology you want.
## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install requirements found in the requirements.txt.

## Usage
```bash
python3 imageRepo.py
```
Then go to [http://127.0.0.1:8050/](http://127.0.0.1:8050/) and follow the steps on the application.

## Features
Currently, there are three main features: a user management system, image adding (single/bulk, private/public), and a search function.
